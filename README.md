## CONTRIBUTE by adding your projects & tutorials!
Enlight is open-source. That means we <3 your creations and want them to be posted on our site! Have a project on the web, in React.js, C++, Python, {insert any cool app in any language/framework}? Doesn't matter! Just send your project and tutorial over. If it's useful, it'll be posted on the site with of course, credit to you!

- fork the repo
- in the project folder, make another folder w/ the project name
- in that folder: include the project demo (w/ it's source files) and a markdown file with the tutorial. 
- create a pull request & and it'll be up ASAP!

**or...**if you don't want to go through GitHub, you can email me your project+tutorial at hi@shamdasani.org

thank you!

## why?
Enlight is a resource aimed at teaching anyone to code by building projects.

My name is Samay Shamdasani and I built enlight. Over the past year, I've been learning to code the web (mainly in JavaScript). At first, I ended up taking many courses and reading books learning about the language. However, I learned so many terms, objects, statements, etc. that I couldn't really implement them. Then, I started to make mini-projects by following tutorials online and scraping through code on GitHub. Here's my attempt at sharing my knowledge of these mini-projects so that you can develop your skills by actually creating something. On here, you'll find a variety of fun, useful, and interesting projects related to web development - and I hope you'll benefit from them.

Think we can work together? Shoot me an email. hi@shamdasani.org
